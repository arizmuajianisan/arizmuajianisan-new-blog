## The Story

I want to create a lab server (it’s just a name, lol)in my home and deploy some apps that I want to use outside my home. Instead of exposing my IP to the Internet (and it is VERY💥 Dangerous) if you can’t set good security on it, after doing some research, I found a way I can expose my local apps to the Internet without changing my Firewall or setting anything on my computer, even exposing any port!

> The answer is using Tunneling from Cloudflare, and the good news is FREE!

## Requirements:

1. Docker, trust me you will be happy using Docker. But if you want to use it another way, Cloudflare has documentation about it, and still easy.

2. A domain, you can purchase one from any provider that you love. Mine from [Domainesia](https://my.domainesia.com/ref.php?u=23913)

3. An app or anything that you want to exposed to the internet.

## Let’s go! 🐱‍🏍

First thing first, go to Cloudflare. You need to sign in if you don’t have an account yet, it’s super easy. I think you will get it.

Once you finish, we will get this page, I already have an active site. We need to click the Add a Site button on the right side.
